Spacer Plate Usage

A Spacer Plate is utilized in mechanical assemblies to:

-Separate Components: Prevents direct contact between parts, reducing friction and wear.
-Distribute Loads: Ensures even weight distribution, enhancing stability and support.
-Adjust Dimensions: Allows for precise spacing adjustments between components for optimal alignment.
-Facilitate Assembly: Simplifies the assembly process by providing a clear guide for positioning parts.
These plates are commonly found in various applications, including machinery, automotive, and structural systems.
